A fun-thing to do!

This is the self-coded clone of www.patatap.com.
@patatap_clone shows you animated shapes along with the sounds in response to a key-press event.

I have used paper.js on top of HTML5 <canvas> element to draw and animate the shapes. Paper.js is an open source graphics and animations scripting framework. (www.paperjs.org).
  
Howler.js is another modern web audio library that makes working with audio in JavaScript easy and reliable. (https://howlerjs.com/)
